				<p>Robert Anglero founded D.A.R.T. in 2013, which was a student in the department of Mechanical Engineering at that time. Since then, D.A.R.T. has competed two times in the NASA Student Launch competition. Unfortunately, the first competition the team could not assist because of financial issues. However, the team completed and presented every report needed for the competition and for that NASA gave the team the Rookie Award. The second competition the team assisted the event and had a successful rocket launch.</p>
